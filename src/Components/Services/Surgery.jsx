                            <p>Although ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) have a considerably smaller medical billing team to handle any concerns or problems that may occur, they face the same billing challenges as hospitals. The stress brought on by attempting to keep up with the intricate coding rules while operating a profitable surgical center is reduced when medical billing is outsourced to Trivium MBS.

We have a dedicated AR recovery team that is extremely successful at getting reimbursements for what others consider “uncollectible.” It is well known in the collections industry that the longer a bill goes unpaid, the less likely it is to be paid—but rather than giving up on old AR recovery & bills. Our account receivables services team takes that as our cue to take immediate action towards identifying and investigating every unpaid claim. Few medical AR billing services are willing to take on aging AR, or if they do, they want a high fee. Our system streamlines the process, allowing us to be efficient enough to work profitably on old AR Recoveries and low-value claims. These are some of the features of our AR recovery system.</p> */}

                            <p>Although payments from insurance networks and public payers are rigid, ASC income can be significantly increased by securing favorable out-of-network provider rates. The process of obtaining the best prices is difficult, and payers have tenacious negotiators working for them.

Benefits verification is particularly crucial in that situation since the ASC will not be compensated if any treatment or operation is provided that is not on the authorized list. The team of qualified experts at Trivium MBS ensures that suggested activities are covered by the patient's coverage, making the services offered reimbursable.</p>
