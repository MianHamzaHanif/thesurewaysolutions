              <h2>The AR Recovery Services of Trivium MBS Increase Revenue</h2>
              <p>With its wide variety of AR management services, Trivium MBS helps clients recover uncollected money from past-due accounts with an aging of more than 120 days. Even from accounts that were once believed to be lost causes, our technology has increased recovery rates dramatically.
                Trivium MBS provides AR medical billing recovery services as a stand-alone alternative, in contrast to the majority of medical billing businesses that only provide AR recovery solutions as a component of a revenue cycle management package. We don't think that healthcare receivable recovery solutions should be generic; instead, they should be tailored to your company's particular needs.

            <h3>Systematic Assessment</h3>
            <p> The initial step when our AR team provides account recovery solutions to a new customer is a careful examination of every outstanding claim. We look for every one that could be recoverable and start working on it, even if there may be some that have expired or are not collectible for some other reason. The "low hanging fruit" is not everything that we are searching for in this process. We examine each claim that could still be paid because we are aware of how quickly little sums can stack up for our customers while many medical billing agencies only seek for huge dollar claims in aging AR.</p>

              <h3>Prioritization</h3>
              <p>To make sure that no claims expire before we get a chance to process them, our staff evaluates older unpaid claims with a high priority. In order to help you recover the most money possible, we remain ahead of the payers' needs by using cutting-edge analytical technologies to reduce medical account receivables. You can concentrate on running your practice knowing that we are taking care of your bottom line since we constantly follow up with each payer to collect your past-due payments.</p>

            <h3>Correction and Resubmission of Claims</h3>
            <p>No claim is ever turned down, refused, or paid insufficiently by our committed taskforce because of a lack of follow-up. We appeal each of those claims when the necessary modifications or clarifications have been provided in order for the insurance company or government payer to reevaluate the payment. We keep track of your claim rejections and denials in order to spot any recurrent issues and permanently fix them in your revenue cycle management system.

              <p>If the AR team determines that the patient should be responsible for paying the remaining debt, we produce and send them an easy-to-understand report. We will also manage the direct communications with your patients if you would like. You don't need to be concerned about communicating the incorrect message to your patients because we are not a collection agency. We make sure everything is simple to grasp because we've discovered that patients are far more likely to pay their bills if they comprehend the charges and concur with the balance owed. If you like, we'll even take their calls and respond to their inquiries.</p>

        </h2>
        <p className=' text-center'>Every year, unpaid claims that are not adequately managed result in significant income losses. We have a committed team that works diligently to recover uncollectible accounts receivable, and they are quite effective at doing so. The collections business is well aware that the longer a bill remains unpaid, the less likely it is to be paid; but, instead of letting up on old AR recovery & invoices, pursue them. That serves as a signal to our team of account receivables services to begin looking for and looking into each overdue claim right away. Only a small number of medical AR billing businesses are willing to handle aged AR, and those that do want a premium cost. Our solution simplifies the procedure and makes us productive enough to handle low-value claims and old AR Recoveries profitably. These are a few of the characteristics of our method for AR recovery.</p>
