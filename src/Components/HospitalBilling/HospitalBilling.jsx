We Eliminate Common Errors and Handle Claim Denials</h2>
<p>As a hospital billing company, we understand that even the most minute errors trigger claim rejections, and every claim that requires reprocessing is costing you valuable resources. If your current medical billing is done in-house, every repeated claim submission increases overhead expenses and results in profit loss. Physicians, nurses, and staff members are often tasked with trying to understand and fix costly hospital billing errors. The time spent on administrative tasks takes away from patient care and places an unnecessary burden on hospital personnel.</p>

We Are Committed to Your Success</h2>
<p>At Medcare MSO, we take a comprehensive, all-inclusive approach to the hospital billing and collection process. Not only do we employ the best and brightest minds, but we also invest in the latest medical billing technologies to provide unparalleled services.. As a hospital billing company, our internal quality control measures ensure accurate claims and an error-free billing process, the first time.

We offer end-to-end services from pre-admission procedures to coding, AR management, collections and follow-up, to detailed real-time reporting. Our hospital clients see reduced operating costs, increased reimbursements and collection ratio, and recovery of AR accounts dating as far back as a full year. Ignored claims, denials, and underpayments can significantly affect your hospital’s revenue stream and bottom line, which can negatively impact your primary focus—patient care. With an increase in the number of insured Americans, accurate charge entry with appropriate billing codes is more critical to institutional billing than ever before.
